# Hamilton Syringe Pump ML600

Hamilton ML600 pumps connected via serial (RS-232) cables are supported in flowchem via the `ML600` device type.
As for all `flowchem` devices, the virtual instrument can be instantiated via a configuration file that generates an
openAPI endpoint.
For a standard (single syringe) pump model, two components will be available: one pump and one valve.
Pumps with multiple syringes are not currently supported.


## Configuration
Configuration sample showing all possible parameters:

```toml
[device.my-ml600-pump]  # This is the pump identifier
type = "ML600"
port = "COM1"  # This will be /dev/tty* under linux/MacOS
address= 1  # If multiple devices are daisy chained, number in the chain 1=first...
syringe_volume = "1 ml"  # If the wrong syringe volume is set, the flow rate will be wrong.
```

```{note} Serial connection parameters
Note, further parameters for the serial connections (i.e. those accepted by `serial.Serial`) such as `baudrate`,
`parity`, `stopbits` and `bytesize` can be specified.
However, it should not be necessary as the following values (which are the default for the instrument) are
automatically used:
* baudrate 9600
* parity even
* stopbits 1
* bytesize 7
```

## API methods
Once configured, a flowchem ML600 object will expose the following commands:

%x```{eval-rst}
%..
%.. include:: api.rst
%```

## Device detection
Lab PCs often have several devices connected via serial ports.
ML600 pumps can be auto-detected via the `flowchem-autodiscover` command-line utility.
After having installed flowchem, run `flowchem-autodiscover` to create a configuration stub with all the devices that
can be auto-detected on your PC.

## Further information
For further information about connection of the pump to the controlling PC, daisy-chaining via RJ-12 cables etc.
