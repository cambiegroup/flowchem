# Huber Chiller
## Introduction
The majority of Huber chillers can be controlled via so-called `PB Commands` over serial communication.
A variety of `PB Commands` are supported in `flowchem`, but some of them may be unavailable on specific models, see the
[manufacturer documentation](./pb_commands_handbook.pdf) for more details.

As for all `flowchem` devices, the virtual instrument can be instantiated via a configuration file that generates an
openAPI endpoint.


## Configuration
Configuration sample showing all possible parameters:

```toml
[device.my-huber-chiller]  # This is the chiller identifier
type = "HuberChiller"
port = "COM11"  # This will be /dev/tty* under linux/MacOS
min_temp = -100  # Min and max temp can be used to further limit the avaiable temperatures
max_temp = +250  # e.g. for compatibility with the reaction system.
```

```{note} Serial connection parameters
Note, further parameters for the serial connections (i.e. those accepted by `serial.Serial`) such as `baudrate`,
`parity`, `stopbits` and `bytesize` can be specified.
However, it should not be necessary as the following values (which are the default for the instrument) are
automatically used:
* baudrate 9600 (with Com.G@te other baud rates are possible)
* parity none
* stopbits 1
* bytesize 8
```

## API methods
Once configured, a flowchem HuberChiller object will expose the following commands:

```{eval-rst}
.. include:: api.rst
```

## Device detection
Lab PCs often have several devices connected via serial ports.
Huber's chillers can be auto-detected via the `flowchem-autodiscover` command-line utility.
After having installed flowchem, run `flowchem-autodiscover` to create a configuration stub with all the devices that
can be auto-detected on your PC.

* baudrate 9600
* parity even

* bytesize 7
