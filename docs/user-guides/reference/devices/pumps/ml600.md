# Hamilton Syringe Pump ML600

Hamilton ML600 pumps connected via serial (RS-232) cables are supported in flowchem via the `ML600` device type.
As for all `flowchem` devices, the virtual instrument can be instantiated via a configuration file that generates an
openAPI endpoint.
For a standard (single syringe) pump model, two components will be available: one pump and one valve.
Pumps with multiple syringes are not currently supported.


## Configuration
Configuration sample showing all possible parameters:

```toml
[device.my-ml600-pump]  # This is the pump identifier
type = "ML600"
port = "COM1"  # This will be /dev/tty* under linux/MacOS
address= 1  # If multiple devices are daisy chained, number in the chain 1=first...
syringe_volume = "1 ml"  # Volume of the syringe used, either a Quantity or number in ml. If the wrong syringe volume 
                         # is set, the flow rate will be wrong.
```

```{note} Serial connection parameters
Note, further parameters for the serial connections (i.e. those accepted by `serial.Serial`) such as `baudrate`,
`parity`, `stopbits` and `bytesize` can be specified.
However, it should not be necessary as the following values (which are the default for the instrument) are
automatically used:
* baudrate 9600
* parity even
* stopbits 1
* bytesize 7
```

```{note} Support for Custom ML600 Configurations
The ML600 device supports custom configurations for pump and valve connections. 
```
Since the ML600 hardware allows for customizable valve setups, `FlowChem` supports this flexibility to ensure accurate 
device configuration and operation. This is particularly important for identifying which valve is connected to which 
pump.

You can specify the desired valve class(es) directly in the device configuration block using the following options:

### Dual-Syringe Setup

For devices with two syringe pumps, you can independently assign valve classes to each side:
```toml
valve_left_class = "ML600LeftValve"    # Options: "ML600LeftValve" or "ML600RightValve"
valve_right_class = "ML600RightValve"  # Options: "ML600LeftValve" or "ML600RightValve"
```

### Single-Syringe Setup

For devices with a single syringe pump, specify only one valve class:
```toml
valve_class = "ML600LeftValve"  # Options: "ML600LeftValve" or "ML600RightValve"
```

## API methods
See the [device API reference](../../api/ml600/api.md) for a description of the available methods.

## Device detection
Lab PCs often have several devices connected via serial ports.
ML600 pumps can be auto-detected via the `flowchem-autodiscover` command-line utility.
After having installed flowchem, run `flowchem-autodiscover` to create a configuration stub with all the devices that
can be auto-detected on your PC.

## Further information
For further information about connection of the pump to the controlling PC, daisy-chaining via RJ-12 cables etc.
please refer to the [manufacturer manual](ml600.pdf).
