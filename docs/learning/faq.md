# FAQ

%### Why no device orchestration functionalities are included?
%Lab automation holds great potential, yet research lab rarely reuse existing code.
%One reason for this is the lack of modularity in the existing lab-automation solutions. While a monolithic approach is 
faster to implement, it lacks flexibility.
%We designed flowchem to be a solid foundation for other modules to be based on.
%We try to follow the unix philosophy: do one thing, and do it well. Flowchem provides uniform API endpoints for the 
heterogeneous environment of lab devices.

%### Why Python 3.10?
%The recommended use of flowchem is to run it as standalone app to provide homogeneous REST API access to the variegated
landscape of lab devices. The direct import of device objects is highly discouraged.
%This allows us to use a recent version of Python and to exploit all the newly introduced features.
%For example, in the codebase are used the walrus operator (`:=`) and `importlib.metadata` introduced in 3.8, the dict
merge with OR operator introduced in 3.9 and the type hints unions with the OR operator 
introduced in 3.10. We are looking forward to the inclusion of `tomllib` in the stdlib for 3.11 to drop the external
dependency on `tomli`.

%### Why FastAPI?
%To create the API endpoints we use fastAPI mainly for its simplicity and for the ability to automatically generate
openAPI specs from the type hints.
%The async aspects were particularly appealing since the communication with lab devices can take relatively long time
(especially on slow protocols such as serial communication at 9600 baud) thus impacting the responsiveness of the API even at low requests/second.

%### Why Pint?
%Different devices use different units for the same quantities. For example, among pumps, Knauer HPLC pumps use ul/min
as base unit, Harvard Apparatus syringe pumps can be set with different units from the nl/h to the ml/s while the
Hamilton ML600 pumps have a custom steps-per-stroke parameter that controls the flow rate.
%Moreover, to offer a uniform experience and prevent errors, the same units should be used by the public API across
different devices, yet the order of magnitudes involved are often experiment-specific.

%To solve all of these problems we decided to adopt [pint](https://pint.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to represent any physical quantity. Particularly
attractive was the possibility of serialize and de-serialize the quantities to strings with minor losses in precision.
This matched our aim of enabling full configurability of device settings via a simple, text-based configuration file.
For example, a syringe diameter can be intuitively specified as either "18.2 mm" or "1.82 cm".

Principles:
- No-code shim: device settings via YAML file creates OpenAPI endpoints with predictable names based on serial numbers.
- Implements existing interoperable standard for lab IoT to avoid standard proliferation.

Implementation design:
- Ideally all permanent device specific parameters (not changing during normal use) are received/set in a uniform way 
and advertised as such (to enabling dynamic graphs config via web interface, somehow similar to Magritek protocol 
options).
- Don't force code-reuse, but allow for easy extension and leave device modules as independent as possible.
- Each device has a name, unique per server, tha will be the endpoint path.

To provide the best possible experience for users, flowchem took inspiration from different aspects of packages with
similar aims, including (in alphabetical order):
