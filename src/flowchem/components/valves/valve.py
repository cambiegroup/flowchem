    # Philosophy: explicitly specify which ports to connect
    # In case of a simple multiposition valve, it always connects the always open central port to the requested port.
    # But there are more complex rotors available, already with an injection valve: connect((1, 2)) is concise and clear.
    # What is even more important, one can specify which ports to not connect (optionally during switching)
    # This issue is most pressing with hamilton valves, where some positions connect 3 ports and it is very hard to
    # foresee what command does what. SO here a simple connect((1,2)) helps.
    # In order for that to work, and to make the coding and usage simple and concise, some definitions are needed:
    # 1) The port zero can exist, but does not necessarily.
    #    For nomenclature reasons, port zero is the one the turning axis and only this one. COmmonly, this port,
    #    if existing, is always open
    # 2) At the physical valve, the upmost is port 1
    #   a) If there is no port straight on top, then one goes in clockwise direction, until a port comes, which is then one
    # 3 )Beware: For logical reasons, we need to introduce ports of "number" None. These are needed because we need to
    #   define dead-ends. These dead-ends are IMMUTABLE dead-ends, so the stator or rotor do not have an opening there
    #   Any time there is a different amount of positions on rotor and stator, Noneports are introduced
    # 5) Mutable dead-ends: blanking plugs are treated as port number, the consumer needs to deal with its definition by
    #   graph or similar since blanking plugs on valve side could be open
    # Dead-ends are needed because we represent valves as graphs, edges are represented by same numbers shared. If a
    # port does not connect to anything, we set it None. There is 1 example where that is strictly needed for the logic
    # to work: Again the hamilton, it will become clear why. So much now: The rotor has more open positions than the
    # stator.
    # 6) The so far mentioned logic only strictly applies to valves facing the user with their front side, however,
    # e.g. the autosampler faces one valve with its always open port to the ground. Simply flip horizontally until it
    # faces you
