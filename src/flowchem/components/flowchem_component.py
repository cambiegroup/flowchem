    A base class for Flowchem components that integrates with a hardware device.

    This class provides the foundational setup for creating components that can
    communicate with hardware devices and expose API routes for interacting with these components.

    Attributes:
    -----------
    name : str
        The name of the component.
    hw_device : FlowchemDevice
        The hardware device instance associated with this component.
    component_info : ComponentInfo
        Metadata about the component.
    _router : APIRouter
        The API router for the component to define HTTP endpoints.

    Methods:
    --------
    add_api_route(path: str, endpoint: Callable, **kwargs):
        Add an API route to the component's router.
    get_component_info() -> ComponentInfo:
        Retrieve the component's metadata.
