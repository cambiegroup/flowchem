    A component for controlling a ClarityChrom system with HPLC functionality.

    This class extends HPLCControl and adds ClarityChrom-specific functionality, such as starting and stopping the ClarityChrom instance and sending methods or running samples.

    Attributes:
    -----------
    hw_device : Clarity
        The ClarityChrom hardware device this component interfaces with.

    Methods:
    --------
    exit() -> bool:
        Exit the ClarityChrom application.
    send_method(method_name: str) -> bool:
        Set the HPLC method using a file with a .MET extension.
    run_sample(sample_name: str, method_name: str) -> bool:
        Run an analysis on the instrument with the specified sample and method.

        While the export of the chromatogram in e.g. ASCII format can be achieved programmatically via the CLI, the best
        solution is to enable automatic data export for all runs of the HPLC as the chromatogram will be automatically
        exported as soon as the run is finished.
