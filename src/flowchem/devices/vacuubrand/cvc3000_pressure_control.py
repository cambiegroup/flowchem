    Attributes:
    -----------
    hw_device : CVC3000
        The hardware device instance of the CVC3000 vacuum controller.

    Methods:
    --------
    set_pressure(pressure: str) -> bool:
        Set the target pressure using a string representation.
    get_pressure() -> float:
        Retrieve the current pressure from the device in mbar.
    is_target_reached() -> bool:
        Check if the target pressure has been reached.
    power_on() -> bool:
        Turn on the pressure control.
    power_off() -> bool:
        Turn off the pressure control.
