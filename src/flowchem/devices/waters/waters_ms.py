"""
This is an ugly attempt to control a Waters Xevo MS via Autolynx.
When the MS is running and Autolynx is running, measuring an MS only requires putting a csv file with specific header
into a specific (and installation dependent) folder.
The Aim of this code is to supply a class that deals with creating the file with right experiment code and fields and
dropping it to the right folder.
