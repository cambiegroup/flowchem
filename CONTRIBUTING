It is great that you are interested in contributing to the project!
Feel free to open issue/PR in the repo, but if you intend to introduce significant changes it is suggested to discuss it
in an issue before submitting a large pull request.

We target Python 3.10+ with src layout.

We use pre-commit for formatters/linter and tox for testing (pytest with coverage and mypy).
Both are run by CI (GitHub Actions) on every commit/PR.
