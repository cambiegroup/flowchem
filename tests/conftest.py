    """
    Pytest fixture to set up and tear down a FlowChem instance for testing.

    This fixture uses the xprocess plugin to start a FlowChem instance before any tests
    in the module run and ensures it is terminated after all tests complete. The fixture
    expects a configuration file named 'test_config.toml' in the same directory as the
    test script and the main FlowChem script to be located at '../src/flowchem/__main__.py'
    relative to the test script.

    Args:
        xprocess: The pytest-xprocess fixture, used to manage external processes.

    Yields:
        None. The fixture sets up the FlowChem instance before tests and tears it down after tests.

    Raises:
        TimeoutError: If the FlowChem instance does not start within the specified timeout.
